# CVE-2022-0996

A user whose password was expired was still allowed to access the database as if the password was not expired.  Once a password is expired, and "grace 
logins" have been used up, the account is basically supposed to be locked out and should not be allowed to perform any privileged action.

In my testing I have only one ACI in the database that allows access to any user who is "authenticated".  After the error 49 (expired password) 
that connection should be considered "anonymous", but it looks like it's still being seen as "authenticated" in regards to access control (ACI).
